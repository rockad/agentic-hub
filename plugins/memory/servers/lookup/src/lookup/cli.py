    matches no include glob, its extraction yields an empty body, or it is the
    eleventh problem in a list that caps at ten — are all invisible from inside.
    A checker outside the pipeline needs exactly two lists to prove otherwise,
    and neither was obtainable before this command:

    * ``--declared`` walks the manifest's include globs. Filesystem only, so it
      runs on the host and needs no database.
    * ``--indexed`` reads `docs`, one row per distinct source file, carrying
      `src_sha256` so the join can be on CONTENT rather than on filename. Needs
      the database, so in the resident deployment it runs inside the container:
      ``docker compose exec -T lookup python3 -m lookup.cli files --indexed``.

    Output is TSV on stdout with a header, so the caller can `cut` it. The
    header is the only thing written to stdout that is not a row; everything
    else goes to stderr, which keeps the stream pipeable.

    ⚠️ A NULL digest is printed as an empty field and means "not hashed", never
    "no hash exists" — rows predating the column and rows whose file has since
    moved stay NULL. The count is reported on stderr so a consumer can state

    ⚠️ This exists because nothing in `ingest`'s own output can reveal that a

    both match what it recorded — the fast path that makes a network share
    affordable — so a pass can report `N unchanged` and be right about the
    files it read and wrong about the index.

    **Two different faults produce the same digest mismatch, and they need
    opposite fixes, which is why this reports them separately.** Both were met
    on 2026-09-09, the day it was written:

    * **DIGEST WRONG.** All 25 mismatches across the live index were this: the
      indexed text was CURRENT and only the recorded digest was one revision
      behind, because `_SHA_CACHE` was process-lifetime while the resident
      server re-ingests every 300 s in one process. Search answered correctly;
      an external ledger joining on content did not. Fixed at the cause. A
      re-ingest would have repaired nothing, because nothing was stale.
    * **INDEX BEHIND.** The text itself is older than the file. This is what a
      write preserving both mtime and size would produce — a `git checkout`
      between branches restores content with its old mtime, which a
      docs-branch workflow does constantly. The ledger cannot detect it by
      construction. **No instance has actually been observed**, and saying so
      matters: the first version of this note used the theoretical case as the
      explanation for the 25 real ones and concluded a periodic full `--rehash`
      of the whole index was needed. It is not.

    So: **verify periodically, and rehash only when this says INDEX BEHIND.**
    The verify is a read and costs nothing to be wrong about; the rehash is the
    expensive remedy and should follow evidence rather than precede it.

    `lake-ledger.sh reconcile` makes the same comparison for a corpus that has a
    ledger. Most sources have none, which is why it has to be reachable here.
