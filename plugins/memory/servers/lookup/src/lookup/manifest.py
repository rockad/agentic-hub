"""Load and enforce the source manifest.

This module is where the inclusion principle is actually enforced, not merely
documented. Two guarantees:

1. `Source.files()` only ever yields paths under that source's declared root,
   matched by an explicit glob from `include`.
2. `Source.contains()` lets the pipeline re-check every document's path before
   it is written, so an extractor that wandered (a symlink, a `..`, a bug)
   is caught rather than silently indexed.

Both matter because the disk holding this archive also holds data that must
never be indexed.

# ── Visibility: whose material this source holds, as data ────────────────────
#
# A fact inherits the visibility of the system it came from. A company-wide
# Slack channel, an unrestricted Notion page, a GitLab group marked `internal`:
# whatever is read there can be reused freely. A DM, a private channel, a
# permission-restricted page: usable only after the fact is verified against
# its source and the user has signed it off. Nothing is ever banned outright —
# provenance decides the ceremony, not whether the material may be used at all.
#
# This lives in the manifest because it is a property of the SOURCE, not of a
# document: the manifest is already the single declaration of what may be
# indexed, so it is also the honest place to declare where that material came
# from. Search results carry the label through, so an agent reading a hit knows
# whether the fact is free to reuse or needs sign-off first.
VISIBILITY_OPEN = "open"
VISIBILITY_GATED = "gated"
# ⚠️ The default is UNSTATED, not "open", and that direction is deliberate. A
# source whose manifest block says nothing about visibility is of *unknown*
# provenance, and the provenance rule treats unknown as gated — so defaulting
# to "open" would silently assert the one thing that cannot be recovered from
# once something has been reused on the strength of it. Defaulting to "gated"
# would be safe but dishonest in the other direction: it would claim the
# manifest had made a judgement it never made, and there would then be no way
# to tell a deliberately-gated source from an undeclared one. So the default
# means "not stated", is reported as such, and is HANDLED as gated
# (`needs_signoff()` below) until someone declares otherwise.
VISIBILITY_UNSTATED = "unstated"
# ── `mixed`: the source declines to state one value, because its objects differ
#
# Added 2026-09-09. Slack is the case that forced it: a
# company-wide channel is `open` and a DM is `gated`, so ONE word for the whole
# corpus is wrong either way — `gated` mislabels the public majority, `open`
# mislabels the private minority, and leaving private channels out of the
# catalogue to dodge the problem violates the rule that nothing is banned as a
# source, only gated.
#
# The alternative was two sources, `slack-public` open and `slack-private`
# gated. It was named and rejected: cheap and honest today, and it breaks the
# moment one channel changes visibility, since the OBJECT would then have to
# move between sources. It also answers Slack only, so the next live system
# reopens the question.
#
# ⚠️ `mixed` is not a loosening. It says *ask the document*, and a document
# that has not answered is `unstated`, which is still handled as gated. What it
# removes is the dishonesty of one word that is wrong for most of the corpus.
