"""Per-document visibility: a document may narrow its source, never widen it.

Decided on 2026-09-09, over the cheaper alternative of splitting a
mixed corpus into two sources. Slack forced it: a company-wide channel is `open`
and a DM is `gated`, so one word for the whole source mislabels most of it
either way, and leaving private channels out to dodge the problem breaks the
rule that nothing is banned as a source, only gated.

Four properties, and each of them is a way the feature could be worse than not
having it:

  * a document may NARROW its source's value and may never WIDEN it — widening
    cannot be taken back, so it must not be reachable by editing front matter
  * an edited label must actually REACH the index; `upsert_ex`'s change
    comparison decides "unchanged", and "unchanged" writes nothing
  * `mixed` must never appear as a HIT's label — it describes a corpus and says
    nothing about the document in hand
  * `--visibility open` must filter in SQL, because LIMIT applies before any
    post-filter would and the caller would silently get fewer results

unittest, not pytest: the Dockerfile's build stage runs `python3 -m unittest`
with nothing installed but this package. See test_search_relax.py.
